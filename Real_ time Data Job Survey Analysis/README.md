# Data Job Survey Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains the Power BI dashboard project focused on analyzing data job surveys. The dashboard was built using Power Query for data transformation and some DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced calculations.

## Project Overview

The Data Job Survey Power BI Dashboard provides insights into various aspects of data-related jobs, including trends, salary distributions, required skills, and job satisfaction. The goal is to help users understand the current job market in the data industry.

### Key Features

- **Data Transformation**: Utilized Power Query to clean and shape the survey data, handling missing values, and creating calculated columns.
- **DAX Calculations**: Applied DAX to perform advanced calculations and create measures for key metrics like average salary, skill frequency, and satisfaction levels.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed a user-friendly and interactive dashboard that allows filtering and deep dives into specific segments of the data job market.

## Dashboard Insights

The dashboard includes several key insights:

1. **Salary Analysis**: Explore salary ranges and distributions across different job roles, experience levels, and regions.
2. **Skill Analysis**: Identify the most in-demand skills and how they impact job opportunities and salaries.
